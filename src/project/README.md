model, made, milage, price , sold (status if car is sold)
another table which contains the manufacturer details for example in the car table , the Mercedes cars has a FK related to PK in the manufacturer  details 

A table contains a sale; sales details information about the customer ( another table) and the card soled ( reference  to car table )
