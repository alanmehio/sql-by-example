In this project you need to create  a database for second had car selling portal

Iso: try to find the specification for this like a car table which has the following:
model, made, milage, price , sold (status if car is sold)
another table which contains the manufacturer details for example in the car table , the Mercedes cars has a FK related to PK in the manufacturer  details 

A table contains a sale; sales details information about the customer ( another table) and the card soled ( reference  to car table )

We need the members to create such a table base on describing each table 
After that the member needs to populate the table with data
After that the member needs query different table based on different question 

Iso: you need to specify the queries to do in point 4 .
   Add more tables if you can to complete the second hand car database

1- Draw the sql schematic based the sql script in car.sql
2- open the database "card.db" from sqlitebrowser and see how to build new tables and export ( uage )
3- You need to build python modules to populate the tables with data
4- You need to show how to search and retrieve pretty print (pprint) of the different data
